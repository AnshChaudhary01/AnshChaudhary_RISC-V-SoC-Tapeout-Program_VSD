# Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

Welcome to Day 4 of the RTL Workshop! Here we focuses on three essential topics in digital design:

- **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**
- **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog**
- **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**

Weâ€™ll learn both the theory and practical implications, complete with hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding.
