# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

This repository chronicles my journey through the **System-on-Chip (SoC) Tapeout Program VSD**. Here, I document my **week-by-week progress** as I learn to design an SoC from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.

This program is part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, which empowers over 3500 participants to build silicon and advance the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.
